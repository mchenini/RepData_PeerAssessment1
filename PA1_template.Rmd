## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## set the working directory
```{r}
setwd("~/DS/reproducible-research-Week2-Project")
```
## unzip the input data file

```{r}
if(!file.exists("activity.csv"))
{
    unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip")
}
```
### read the activity file into a data frame

```{r}
activityData <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv", header = TRUE)
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```
### get info on the activityData data frame

```{r}
str(activityData)
```
### Get a summary of the data

```{r}
summary(activityData)
```


### check the class of the date column and convert it to a Data class
```{r}
activityData$date <-  as.Date(activityData$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
class(activityData$date)
```
  

```{r}
dailyStepSum <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r}
histData <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(histData, breaks = 19, col = "blue", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylab = "Number of days", main = "Frequency of Total number of steps per day")
```

### mean and median 

```{r}
meanDataByInterval <- mean(histData, na.rm = TRUE)
medianDataByInterval <- median(histData, na.rm=TRUE)
```


```{r}
fiveMinSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activityData, FUN =mean)
head(fiveMinSteps)
```


### Average daily activity pattern  - time series plot 
### 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, that contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
stepsIntervalMean <- tapply(activityData$steps, as.factor(activityData$interval), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(levels(as.factor(activityData$interval)), stepsIntervalMean, type = "l", xlab = "Five Minute Interval",
     ylab = "Number of Steps", main = "Mean Number of Steps based on 5 Minute Intervals", col = "red")
```

```{r}
stepsIntervalMax <- which.max(stepsIntervalMean)
intervalMax <- as.numeric(levels(as.factor(activityData$interval)))[stepsIntervalMax]
intervalMax
```
### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
stepsMax <- as.numeric(stepsIntervalMean[stepsIntervalMax])
stepsMax
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?


## Imputing missing values

### Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r}
nbrNAs <- nrow(activityData[!complete.cases(activityData), ])
nbrNAs
```

### Clean the data
```{r data cleaning, results = "hide"}
cleanData <- na.omit(activityData)
```

 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
dataByDay <- group_by(cleanData, date)
```

### Get a summary of the data

```{r}
summary(dataByDay)
```

### Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
replaceWithMean <- function(num) replace(num, is.na(num), mean(num, na.rm = TRUE))
dataComplete <- (activityData %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(steps = replaceWithMean(steps)))
head(dataComplete)
```
### Verify no more NA in dataComplete
```{r}
sum(is.na(dataComplete))
```

### Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
cleanDataComplete <- tapply(dataComplete$steps, dataComplete$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(cleanDataComplete, breaks = 19, col = "green", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylab = "Number of days", main = "Frequency of Total number of complete steps per day")
```
### Calculate the mean and median total number of steps taken per day of the new complete clean data

```{r}
stepsCompleteMean <- mean(cleanDataComplete, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsCompleteMean
```
```{r}
stepsCompleteMedian <- median(cleanDataComplete, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsCompleteMedian
```

### Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
### Before cleaning
```{r}
meanDataByInterval
medianDataByInterval
```

### After cleaning
```{r}
stepsCompleteMean
stepsCompleteMedian
```
###  We see a slight difference in the mean and median before and adter the data cleaning


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
dataComplete$day <- ifelse(weekdays(dataComplete$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
```

### display 
```{r}
head(dataComplete)
```
###  Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r}
wday <- subset(dataComplete, day == "weekday")
wday.steps <- aggregate(wday$steps, list(wday$interval), mean)
wday.steps$day <- "Weekday"
colnames(wday.steps) <- c("Interval", "Mean.Steps", "day")

wend <- subset(dataComplete, day == "weekend")
wend.steps <- aggregate(wend$steps, list(wend$interval), mean)
wend.steps$day <- "Weekend"
colnames(wend.steps) <- c("Interval", "Mean.Steps", "day")

activity.data.weekday <- rbind(wday.steps, wend.steps)
```
### The two Time Series plots
```{r}
library(lattice)
xyplot(Mean.Steps ~ Interval | day, activity.data.weekday, type = "l", layout = c(1,2), 
       ylab = "Average Number of Steps", main = "Average Number of Steps in 5 minute intervals Wday vs Wend", col = "green")
```

### There are some differences at the beginning of the graphs between weekdays and weekends.
